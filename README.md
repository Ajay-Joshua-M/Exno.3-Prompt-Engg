# EXPERIMENT – 3: Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques
# Aim: 
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. Using Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting and Preceding Question Prompting techniques.

# Tools Required:
•	AI-based text generation platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity AI)
•	Word/Excel for organizing conversations and response comparisons
•	Internet access for testing AI responses (if applicable)

# Theory:
Prompt engineering is a critical technique in AI chatbot development, particularly for customer service applications. It involves crafting specific inputs (prompts) to obtain desired outputs from large language models (LLMs). Different prompting techniques can greatly affect the quality, relevance, and clarity of responses.
In this experiment, we focus on:
1.	Straightforward Prompting:
o	A direct method of asking questions or issuing commands.
o	Useful for obtaining quick, focused responses to simple user needs.
2.	Tabular Format Prompting:
o	Instructs the AI to present information in structured table form.
o	Ideal for presenting lists, comparisons, step-by-step guides, or status updates.
3.	Preceding Question Prompting:
o	Builds a logical flow of conversation based on the context of previous responses.
o	Mimics natural human interactions and improves user engagement.
These prompting techniques enhance the chatbot's versatility and make it adaptable to different levels of complexity in customer service queries.

# Experiment Procedure:
We simulated 3 core customer support scenarios:
1.	Product Troubleshooting
2.	Order Tracking
3.	General Inquiry
Each scenario was tested with all three prompting techniques. The chatbot's responses were recorded and evaluated based on clarity, accuracy, user-friendliness, and contextual appropriateness.

# Scenario 2: Order Tracking
Prompt	Prompting Type	Bot Response
"Where is my order #12345?"	Straightforward Prompt	"Your order #12345 is out for delivery and will reach you by 7 PM today."
"List my recent orders, their status, and expected delivery dates in a table."	Tabular Format Prompt	(Bot Response: neat table with Order ID, Status, Expected Delivery columns)
"My order is delayed." ➔ "It’s delayed due to weather." ➔ "Can I cancel it?"	Preceding Question Prompt	(Bot guides the customer to cancellation options after explaining the delay.)

# Scenario 3: General Inquiry
Prompt	Prompting Type	Bot Response
"What is your return policy?"	Straightforward Prompt	"You can return products within 30 days, provided they are unused and in original packaging."
"List return conditions, refund methods, and processing times in a table."	Tabular Format Prompt	(Bot Response: table showing conditions for return, refund timelines, and payment modes.)
"Can I return a used product?" ➔ "Generally no, unless it’s defective." ➔ "How do I file for a defective product?"	Preceding Question Prompt	Step-by-step help conversation for returns.

# Prompting Type	Best Used For	Strengths	Weaknesses
Straightforward Prompting	Quick, factual answers	Very fast, direct	May feel robotic sometimes
Tabular Format Prompting	Structured information (orders, policies)	Clear for multi-item information	Not conversational
Preceding Question Prompting	Natural, detailed troubleshooting	Feels human, easy to guide complex processes	May take longer
Analysis:

# Evaluation and Observations:
•	Straightforward Prompting was very effective for direct questions like order status or simple return policies.
•	Tabular Prompting gave the clearest outputs when the user needed detailed or structured info, like troubleshooting steps or multiple orders.
•	Preceding Question Prompting created the best customer experience, allowing dynamic conversations that adapted based on user answers.
Thus, combining different prompting styles allows the chatbot to be both efficient and user-friendly.

# Conclusion:
Thus, by applying Straightforward Prompting, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting techniques, the AI-powered chatbot was able to efficiently resolve various types of customer queries while maintaining a conversational, clear, and organized tone.
Different types of prompts handled different scenarios better, improving overall support effectiveness.

# Result:
Thus, the prompts were designed and executed successfully.
The chatbot demonstrated the ability to handle troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries using a mix of Straightforward, Tabular, and Preceding Question Prompting strategies, thereby enhancing customer service experience.
